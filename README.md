Below is a well-structured **README.md** file tailored for your combat game project. It provides an overview, setup instructions, and a reference to your milestones document, making it easy to onboard yourself (or others) and track progress. Since you're coding with Cursor AI, I’ve kept it concise and developer-friendly, assuming you’ll use it as a quick reference while working through the milestones.

# Combat Game Project

A 3D survival-combat game built with TypeScript and Babylon.js, featuring extensible character classes (starting with Archer) and enemies (starting with Goblin). The game uses realistic Mixamo models, WASD controls for movement, and character-specific abilities (e.g., right-click aiming for Archer). This is my first game dev project, leveraging 5 years of development experience with an OOP-focused approach.

## Project Overview
- **Genre:** Survival-Combat
- **Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Babylon.js, Mixamo (models/animations)
- **Core Features:**
  - Playable characters: Archer (initial), Warrior, Wizard (future)
  - Enemies: Goblin (initial), expandable later
  - Controls: WASD (movement), mouse left-click (attack), right-click (character-specific ability)
  - Realistic environment with terrain and lighting
- **Goal:** Build a modular, scalable game incrementally, starting with Archer vs. Goblin combat.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm (v8+ recommended)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code with Cursor AI)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository** (or initialize locally):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>  # If using Git, otherwise skip
   cd combat-game
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Installs TypeScript and Babylon.js as per `package.json`.
3. **Compile TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc
   ```
   - Outputs JavaScript to a `dist/` folder (adjust `tsconfig.json` if needed).
4. **Run the Game:**
   - Serve `index.html` via a local server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code Live Server).
   - Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser.
5. **Development Workflow:**
   - Follow `milestones.md` for step-by-step tasks.
   - Use Cursor AI to implement each task, then verify completion.

```

## Development Plan
See `milestones.md` for detailed milestones and tasks. The project is broken into small, logical steps:
1. Project Setup & Core Systems
2. Archer Character Foundation
3. Environment Setup
4. Goblin Enemy Foundation
5. Combat Basics
6. (Future) Additional characters/enemies

## Running the Game
- Ensure `dist/` contains compiled JS files after `npx tsc`.
- Open `index.html` in a browser via a local server.
- Check console for logs during development (e.g., input detection, aiming toggle).

## Notes
- Assets (e.g., Mixamo FBX files) must be manually downloaded and placed in `src/assets/models/`.
- Use Babylon.js docs (https://doc.babylonjs.com/) for reference.
- Milestones are designed for Cursor AI—keep tasks focused to avoid confusion.

## Contributing
This is a solo project for now—feedback welcome as I learn game dev!

### Next Steps for You
1. Create a new folder (e.g., `combat-game/`).
2. Save this as `README.md` in the root.
3. Save the previous milestones as `milestones.md` in the root.
4. Run `npm init -y` to create `package.json`.
5. Add an `index.html` file (basic HTML with a `<canvas>` for Babylon.js).
6. Start coding Milestone 1 with Cursor AI!

Let me know if you need the `index.html` snippet or help with `package.json`/`tsconfig.json` before you begin. Happy coding—can’t wait to hear how it goes!
