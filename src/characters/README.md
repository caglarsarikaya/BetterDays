# Characters Directory

This directory contains character classes following SOLID principles.

- `BaseCharacter`: Abstract class for all playable characters
- `Archer`: First implemented character with bow and arrow abilities
- Future characters: Warrior, Wizard, etc.

Classes in this directory follow the Single Responsibility Principle by focusing only on character behavior.
