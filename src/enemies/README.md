# Enemies Directory

This directory contains enemy classes following SOLID principles.

- `BaseEnemy`: Abstract class for all enemies
- `Goblin`: First implemented enemy with basic chasing behavior
- Future enemies: Orc, Skeleton, etc.

Classes in this directory follow the Open/Closed Principle, allowing for extension without modification.
